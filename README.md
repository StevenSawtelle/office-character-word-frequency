A little side project born out of my curiosity as to what the characters of NBC's The Office said most throughout the season. I tried to comment it to be pretty clear, and nothing too crazy is done here in all honesty. The script is ready to run out of the box, assuming nothing changes about officequotes.net, where the info is being pulled from. There's definitely improvements to be made, and it can also be modularized to work with other shows. I recommend someone doing that, and if you do, please let me know! I'd love to see it

## Huge thanks to officequotes.net for providing the data this whole project was based off.
